# ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

Please note that Misery 2.0 is currently under active development and **not ready for release**. 

## Current State

The mod is still missing several code functionalities and is in the process of being prepared for the **2.0 build**. We are also in the process of conducting extensive testing, including **multiplayer testing**.

**Misery** draws inspiration from renowned mods such as DayZ, Ravage, Heros Survive, and acclaimed games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. However, it distinguishes itself through the incorporation of custom assets and a unique, challenging twist on survival mechanics

The mod also showcases the collaborative efforts of various community authors and friends. Designed as a framework, Misery aims to augment the creative possibilities for scenario designers in crafting a post-apocalyptic world

We trust that this mod will serve as a valuable tool in realizing your vision for a compelling, immersive gaming experience
